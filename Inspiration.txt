Color palettes - What looks clean? What colors compliment each other that you wouldn't normally try?
    https://www.legalzoom.com/ - very clean design/smart use of color w/o the site coming off cold or sterile
    https://www.cheyennegil.com/ - The type of photography that she does + the wine/white/grey - set the mood for the site 
    beautifully
Pages with a good layout or structure
    https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ - I like that even tho it's a lot of posts that are shown, it's blocked/broken up
    in a very smart way, where it's not overwhelming and yet you could get "stuck" clicking/reading for hours
    https://iconwerk.com/ - They present their work upfront, and it's a lot of icons but presented so that it's not
    stimulating to the eye. You feel impressed with how they showcase this thing (icon) that no one pays attention to 
    and really make it the star
Any websites you visit daily where you appreciate the design or a feature
    
Font/Topography - Think of what is easy to read or looks neat. A headliner or banner text is also acceptable.
Visual effect or clever display of data - Perhaps animated graph or user interactivity
